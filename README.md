# NeighbourGood - Community Connection App

Welcome to our [Northcoders Coding Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp) Final Group Project, NeighbourGood!

NeighbourGood is a powerful community-driven app designed to strengthen neighbourhoods by connecting neighbours, where they can engage in conversations, request or offer help, such as DIY, do the shopping, walk a dog etc.

Developed in just 1.5 weeks by a passionate team of four - [Sam](https://github.com/samelawton), [Nikita](https://github.com/LendiDev), [Tope](https://github.com/Topecoding206) and [Kristaps](https://github.com/Kristaps31).

## Major Achievements

During this project, we achieved several milestones:

- Learning and implementing new technologies: Our team successfully learned and implemented **Flutter** for the Front-end and **Firebase** for the Back-end, despite being new to these technologies.

- Implementing authentication and registration: We integrated Firebase Authentication to handle user registration and authentication, ensuring a secure and seamless experience for users when signing up and logging in.

- Facilitating help and offer requests: We designed NeighbourGood to enable users to create help requests and offer assistance within their neighborhood, fostering a supportive environment for community members to connect and collaborate.

- Implementing maps with geo location: We integrated Google Maps API to determine, display the user's location.

- Implementing messaging and comments: We created a messaging feature that allows users to interact with other users and added a comments section for users to engage in conversations on offers and help requests.

- Implementing profile customization: We developed a feature that enables users to upload and customize their profile pictures, as well as edit their personal information.

- Creating an accessible and simple user experience: We focused on ensuring that the app is universally easy to use for everyone, making it an inclusive platform for all members of the community.

- Effective planning and teamwork: Our team collaborated efficiently, utilizing various tools for communication, task management, and planning. We worked together to tackle challenges, share ideas, and ensure everyone's contributions were valued throughout the development process.

Our team is proud of what we've accomplished within the short timeframe, and we believe that NeighbourGood is a functional and user-friendly app that will make a positive impact on local communities.
